# Conclusion

This thesis explores the potential of NA to enhance our understanding of the Berlin transportation system\'s evolution, particularly concerning the impact of the Berlin Wall. We achieve mixed success, identifying both the strengths and limitations of our model and the NA approaches employed.

Simple metrics proved effective in revealing overarching network growth trends (Chapter 3.1), and our investigation into preferential attachment characteristics confirmed their presence in the network\'s evolution. However, attempts to pair preferential attachment with a fitness score based on area utilisation yielded inconclusive results. While our fitness metric might not have been a primary driver of network expansion, the correlation found between network strength increase and population change supports the expected influence of demographic factors on this system.

The most complex aspect of our analysis, link prediction, did not yield results that directly addressed our historical research question about the Berlin Wall\'s impact. This indicates that the assumptions inherent in methods like Triadic Closure Principle and L3 may not be directly applicable to our transportation network. However, these results offer a foundation for refining the network model, such as grouping nodes into larger geographic areas, to potentially improve link prediction capabilities.

Regarding the model itself, we have to acknowledge biases and incompleteness in our historical sources. Despite these limitations, the model\'s ability to incorporate external data and analyse nodes geographically demonstrates its flexibility and potential that is useful for further historical research into the development of Berlin's public transportation system.

While foundational theories like preferential attachment translate well to our historical network, domain-specific fitness approaches (inspired by economics) prove less successful. Historical data\'s complexity and the interconnectedness of real-world factors make isolating variables for analysis difficult, unlike controlled laboratory settings. This highlights the challenge of directly applying specialised DNA methods from fields like bioinformatics to diverse historical research contexts. For instance, methods like L3, which were developed to predict missing links in protein-protein networks, rely on assumptions about network structure that may not hold true for historical transportation networks. This suggests that successful application of NA in historical research might depend on the generality of the method. Theories like preferential attachment, which describe broad network growth patterns across various real-world systems, seem more adaptable in this regard. However, further research is needed to determine the specific NA principles that offer the most generalisable insights across diverse historical contexts.

Ultimately, this thesis underscores the value of both quantitative and qualitative research in the field of digital history. NA provides a unique lens to measure change, but it is through dialogue with sources that we gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of how Berlin\'s public transportation system transformed over time. In our pursuit of applying external domain knowledge we must not leave our the methodologies and theories that make our historical scholarship field.
